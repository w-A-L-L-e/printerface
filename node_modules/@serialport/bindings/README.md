# @serialport/Bindings

The `Binding` is how Node-SerialPort talks to the underlying system. By default, we auto detect Windows, Linux and OS X, and load the appropriate module for your system. You can assign `SerialPort.Binding` to any binding you like. Find more by searching ["serialport-binding" at npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=serialport-binding).
