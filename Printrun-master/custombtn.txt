###Defining custom buttons for pronterface is easy. Here's how.
###Below these instructions, add a line with the following format for each button
# ["button name","command",color(RGB)], <--That comma is important, do not forget it
###As an example: (Remove the # to try it out):
#["Read temp","M105",(200,100,100)],
#["Disable Axes","M84",(400,100,100)],
###You can use gcodes or any pronsole/pronterface commands
###The first four buttons will end up at the top of the window, visible in mini mode
###The rest of the buttons will be at the bottom under the gcode preview
